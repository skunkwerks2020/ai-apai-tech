## README - Implementation of APAI Concepts - Javascript

# Definitions

APAI - Applied Artificial Intelligence

# Purpose

Purpose of this repository is to show examples of FULL and COMPLETE implementations of concepts found in Generative AI forums such as LangChain, however, which suffer from a simple lift of knowledge for newcomers to the technology.

# Approach

If you know absolutely nothing about AI, prompt engineering, how that works - visit our good friends at http://learnpromting.org

However, the desire of this repository is for you to find examples that show basic building blocks in their completion. There is nothing more infuriating when people show code taken out of context, broken into paragraphs in a blog intented to drive clicks/likes and not deliver actual value.
You can have 10 years of experience in the tech field, however a new library can be truly difficult to figure out how to use it if there is no simple clear example on how to use it.

Lastly, we will have more complex examples, however we will do our best to show the hard demarcations between concepts, in order for you to be able to lift what you need and put it in your project.

# Intended Audience

This repository assumes some knowledge of AI/Prompting/tech stacks.
